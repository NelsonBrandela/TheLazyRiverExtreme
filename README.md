#Features:

#Push Notifications:

The game will make use of push notifications if allowed by the user, in order to inform them of updates to the game, new available items, or changes to the available stock of inventory. It may also make use of push notifications to make users remember to play the game.

#Achievements:

The game will make use of an achievement system so that players can track their own progress, and have personal goals to strive for while playing the game.

#LeaderBoards:

The game will utilise leaderboards in order to give players a competitive goal to strive for against their friends or other players worldwide. It will give a second form of goals that are independent of the available achievements to collect.

#Analytics:

The game will make use of analytics if permitted in order to check user engagement, and which features of the game are the most desired and utilised. This will be used in order to get a better understanding of our playerbase, and tailor new content to the masses.
Ads Supported:

The game will have ads within certain areas of the game, depending on the upfront charge, and the average cost and use of the premium in game store. Ads will try to be as unobstructive as possible, in an attempt to keep from interrupting player engagement.

#Value:

The value of this app to its user will be having a hassle-free app, that can be enjoyed both with or without a connection to the internet. It will provide them with a never ending challenge that they can continually improve on, during any free time that they have. Whether it be commuting, or while using the facilities, the game will be available for them to enjoy at their leisure.

#Traversing the App:

The user will begin by starting up the app, and being shown the splash screen for the game.


After the splash screen is finished the player will be shown the Main Menu of the game, which will lead off to any other area of the app.



From the main Menu, a user at this point, based on their priorities, will either check the shop for new items, the leaderboards to check the change in the standings, or achievements to see what else they still need to accomplish.






From this point the user will either check the remaining screens above, or will move on to start their next game.



Once the user completes their match, they will be presented with the results screen, which will allow them to see their results and from this screen they can go back to either the Shop, Leaderboards, Achievements, or Main menu.



At this point the process will repeat, or the user will quit the game until another time.
